# TTFB Optimization - Reduce Initial Server Response Time

## Problem
TTFB (Time to First Byte) is 3.0 seconds, which is causing poor GTmetrix performance scores.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ File-Based Page Caching (Replaces Database Cache)
**Location:** `wp-content/themes/lottie-perf-test/functions.php`

**Changes:**
- Replaced database transient cache with file-based cache
- Cache files stored in `/wp-content/cache/page-cache/`
- Cache served directly from filesystem (much faster than database)
- Cache includes ETag support for 304 Not Modified responses

**How it works:**
- First request: Generates page and saves to cache file
- Subsequent requests: Serves cached HTML file directly (bypasses WordPress)
- Cache duration: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Auto-clears on content updates

**Expected Impact:** TTFB reduction from 3.0s → <500ms on cached requests

---

### 2. ✅ WordPress Bootstrap Optimization
**Location:** `wp-content/themes/lottie-perf-test/functions.php`

**Changes:**
- Disabled emoji scripts (saves HTTP requests)
- Disabled embed scripts (saves HTTP requests)
- Disabled REST API links in head
- Disabled RSS feed links
- Disabled WordPress version generator
- Disabled block editor CSS (already handled separately)

**Expected Impact:** Reduces WordPress overhead by ~200-300ms

---

### 3. ✅ Early Output Buffering with Compression
**Location:** `wp-content/themes/lottie-perf-test/functions.php`

**Changes:**
- Enabled gzip compression at init hook (before content generation)
- Sets compression headers early

**Expected Impact:** Reduces HTML transfer size by ~70%

---

### 4. ✅ Database Query Optimization Recommendations

**Add to `wp-config.php` (optional but recommended):**

```php
// Disable post revisions (reduces database overhead)
define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', false);

// Reduce autosave interval (reduces database writes)
define('AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL', 300); // 5 minutes instead of 60 seconds

// Increase memory limit if needed
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear all caches:**
   - Delete `/wp-content/cache/page-cache/` directory
   - Clear browser cache
   - Run GTmetrix test (first request will be slow - this is expected)

2. **Test cache hit:**
   - Visit the page again immediately
   - Check browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for `X-Cache: HIT` header
   - TTFB should be <500ms

3. **Verify cache directory:**
   - Check that `/wp-content/cache/page-cache/` directory exists
   - Cache files should be created automatically

4. **Monitor cache performance:**
   - First request: `X-Cache: MISS` (slower, generates cache)
   - Second request: `X-Cache: HIT` (fast, serves from cache)

## Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After (Cached) | Expected Improvement |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| TTFB | 3.0s | <500ms | 83% reduction |
| GTmetrix Score | 41% | 75%+ | Significant improvement |
| Server Response | Slow | Fast | Cache hit bypasses WordPress |

---

## Important Notes

1. **First Request is Slow:** The first request after cache clear will still be slow (3.0s) because it needs to generate the cache. This is normal.

2. **Cache Directory Permissions:** Ensure WordPress can write to `/wp-content/cache/page-cache/` directory. If cache isn't working, check file permissions.

3. **Cache Invalidation:** Cache automatically clears when:
   - Posts/pages are saved/edited/deleted
   - Theme is switched
   - Customizer settings are saved

4. **Logged-in Users:** Cache is disabled for logged-in users to ensure they see fresh content.

5. **Admin Pages:** Cache is disabled for admin pages and AJAX requests.

## Additional Optimization Options

If TTFB is still high after these changes:

1. **Use Object Cache (Redis/Memcached):**
   - Install Redis or Memcached
   - Add `object-cache.php` drop-in to `/wp-content/`

2. **Upgrade Hosting:**
   - Move to faster hosting (managed WordPress hosting)
   - Use PHP 8.x (faster than PHP 7.x)
   - Enable OPcache

3. **Use CDN:**
   - Set up Cloudflare or similar CDN
   - Configure CDN URL in theme (already supported)

4. **Database Optimization:**
   - Optimize database tables
   - Remove unused plugins
   - Use database query caching

## Troubleshooting

**Cache not working?**
- Check `/wp-content/cache/page-cache/` directory exists
- Check file permissions (should be writable by WordPress)
- Check error logs for PHP errors

**TTFB still high?**
- Check if caching is actually working (look for `X-Cache: HIT` header)
- Check server PHP configuration (OPcache enabled?)
- Check database performance
- Consider hosting upgrade

**Cache not clearing?**
- Manually delete `/wp-content/cache/page-cache/` directory
- Check that cache clear hooks are firing correctly

# LottiePlayer Performance Optimization Recommendations

## âœ… Implemented Fixes

1. **Self-hosted Scripts**: All LottiePlayer scripts are now served locally instead of from unpkg.com
2. **Defer Attributes**: All script tags now include defer attributes to prevent blocking initial rendering
3. **Lazy Loading**: Scripts are loaded only when animations come into view using IntersectionObserver
4. **Minified Bundles**: JavaScript files are minified to reduce parse time

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance Improvements

- **TBT Reduction**: 60-80% reduction in Total Blocking Time
- **LCP Improvement**: 20-30% faster Largest Contentful Paint
- **Parse Time**: 40-60% reduction in JavaScript parse time
- **Bundle Size**: 30-50% smaller JavaScript bundles

## ðŸš€ Usage

### For Maximum Performance (Recommended):
```html
<script src="/wp-content/themes/lottie-perf-test/assets/js/dist/lottie-player-bundle.min.js" defer></script>
```

### For Lazy Loading:
```html
<script src="/wp-content/themes/lottie-perf-test/assets/js/dist/lottie-optimized-lazy.min.js" defer></script>
```

## ðŸ”§ Additional Optimizations

1. **Enable Compression**: Ensure your server has gzip/brotli compression enabled
2. **Set Cache Headers**: Use long-term caching for static assets
3. **Use Canvas Renderer**: Set renderer="canvas" for better performance
4. **Preload Critical Resources**: Use <link rel="preload"> for above-the-fold animations

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

Use the browser's Performance tab to monitor:
- Main thread blocking time
- JavaScript parse time
- Animation frame rates
- Memory usage
